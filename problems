-Write a program that prints ‘Hello World’ to the screen.
-Write a program that asks the user for her name and greets her with her name.
-Modify the previous program such that only the users Alice and Bob are greeted with their names.

- Write a function that takes a number n as argument and prints the sum of the numbers 1 to n
Eg: sum(20)
      => 210
- Modify the function such that only multiples of three or five, but not both are considered in the sum, e.g. 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 12, 18 for n=19
Eg: special_sun(19)
      => 63
- Write a function that takes a number 'n' as argument and prints a multiplication table for 'n' up to 12.
Eg: multiplication_table(3)
      =>
        3X 1=3
        3X 2=6
        3X 3=9
        3X 4=12
        3X 5=15
        3X 6=18
        3X 7=21
        3X 8=24
        3X 9=27
        3X10=30
        3X11=33
        3X12=36
- Write a function that takes a four digit year number as input and prints the next 100 leap years from the given year.
- Given a sentence, reverse all words of the sentence. Try to do it using minimum lines of code, using high level string methods provided by language.
Eg: reverse_words(“This is a cat”)
      => “sihT si a tac”
- Write a function that takes a number and prints all of its digits, one per line, starting from left to right. (Without using string methods)
Eg: print_digits(235)
      =>
        2
        3
        5
- Write a function that takes a number as input and prints the number in words. (Assume that the input is in the range 1 to 999,999,999; both inclusive)
Eg: print_number(235)
      => Two Hundred and Thirty Five
